<p>Journal Entry 1 10/18/21: So far in CS1 I have learned how to code a basic website. I also have created a person card with a website attached to it. I now can quickly input photos and text into websites. I am currently working on a belated birthday card for Caleb. </p>
<p>
Journal Entry 2 10/21/21: I recently finished making the beginning to my brother's belated birthdy card. I made it for him because I wanted him to know that I greatly appreciate him. I am happy with what I have made, but I want to add more details and improvments before I give it to him. I am frustrated with centering the text in the "menu" bar because I have tried a variety of things, but they have not worked. Some things taht I need to learn are how to create and style a link (and links to other pages of your website), position divs around the page, EXPLAIN the relationship between CSS and HTML, and work when my code is not showing up the way I expect it to.

Journal Entry 3 11/2/21: A variable is a name for a certain group of information/code. A function is a list of instructions that carry out a certain action (in the code). You can make a function run by giving a variable a document.getElementListener and then the variable an ID, and then giving the variable a console log. Some of the words that I have learned so far are var, event, EventListener, function, document, and script. In my codesketch, I use my function to make the image of an anime character (Monkey D. Luffy) move around the screen when the user clicks.

Journal Entry 4 12/1/21: It is the first day of December! Comp sci has been going very well. I just made a little project that helped me learn how to make an image teleport to wherever you click and a loop where an image continuously appears. I have been working on java script and understanding what "append child" means.
Explain stuff

Journal Entry 5 12/6/21: I recently finished my random pokemon generator. It took quite a while, but after working out a bunch of little kinks in my code, I made a nice random generator. This project was an array.

	Journal Entry 6 1/17/22: I just finished another project. In this project, I have created a variable with a designated photo of guy fieri holding a massive glizzy that follows wherever your mouse goes. Instead of the photo following the cursor, more photos are spawned.

	Journal Entry 7 2/14/22: I made my Valentines day card for my mother and she really enjoyed it. In this project I had a div that contained all of the text for my letter to my mom. In addition, I made it so that every time you click anywhere on the screen, an image of a white cartoon balloon appears where the cursor is. Initally I had difficulties with making the balloon appear directly where the click is, but then I coded it so that the clcik is aligned with the center of the image. This project helped me learn how to use Javascript more fluently.

	Journal Entry 8 2/25/22: Our entire class is making appreciation cards for cherished people in our lives. Many other kids decided to make cards for each other, but I wanted to make something for my Dad because he sometimes is underappreciated for the great work that he does in my family. To make this card, I first coded a start screen, which is just a box of text saying how much I love him and am grateful to have him as my Dad. Second, I made an array, so that when you click in the middle of the page, a new photo of him with people in our family appears with the corresponding description of the image. I had trouble with getting all the photos to be linked to each name, however, I inspected the code thouroughly to find its discrepancies.
