<p>Journal Entry 1 10/18/21: So far in CS1 I have learned how to code a basic website. I also have created a person card with a website attached to it. I now can quickly input photos and text into websites. I am currently working on a belated birthday card for Caleb.

Journal Entry 2 10/21/21: I recently finished making the beginning to my brother's belated birthdy card. I made it for him because I wanted him to know that I greatly appreciate him. I am happy with what I have made, but I want to add more details and improvments before I give it to him. I am frustrated with centering the text in the "menu" bar because I have tried a variety of things, but they have not worked. Some things taht I need to learn are how to create and style a link (and links to other pages of your website), position divs around the page, EXPLAIN the relationship between CSS and HTML, and work when my code is not showing up the way I expect it to.

Journal Entry 3 11/2/21: A variable is a name for a certain group of information/code. A function is a list of instructions that carry out a certain action (in the code). You can make a function run by giving a variable a document.getElementListener and then the variable an ID, and then giving the variable a console log. Some of the words that I have learned so far are var, event, EventListener, function, document, and script. In my codesketch, I use my function to make the image of an anime character (Monkey D. Luffy) move around the screen when the user clicks.
