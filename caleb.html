<p> Happy belated birthday bro! I cannot believe your old a## is already 17. I made this card for you because I want to show my appreciation for you. You have always been a great big brother and I cannot wait to see you succeed as an adult. I know you have been studying very hard for your standardized tests and have been working a lot in school. Our whole family notices the effort you put in and are excited to see the results. Althought your birthday was about a week ago, I still wanted to make this for you because you deserve it. 

	Best,
	Little Caleb
